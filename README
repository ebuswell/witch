libwitch is a library that intends to make the C language more
functional.

Requirements
------------
libwitch extends and makes use of atomickit. At the moment both should be the
latest git. At this point, currying is dependent on libffi, but more efficient
versions could be created.

Installation
------------
Link config.def.mk to config.mk, or copy config.def.mk to config.mk and edit
to match your local setup (this is installed under /usr/local by default).
Then enter the following commands:

	make
	sudo make install
